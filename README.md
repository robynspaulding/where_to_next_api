# Where To Next? 
Ruby on Rails API

Where To Next? is a travel planning app that allows a user to create a trip and add places they want to visit while they are on that trip. Within the trip show page -or rather where you can see the details of the trip and the places you want to go - there is a search bar that accesses a third-party API called <a href="https://serpapi.com/"> SerpApi </a> which scrapes Google results based on your search query and location input.

## Roadmap

While this is currently a basic, user input only trip planner my goal is to create another backend api to act as a third party api which will house a database of Scuba Diving sites including the name and description of the site, a list of common sea life and topography, longitude and latitude and how itâ€™s accessed either by boat or from the shore. My plan is to begin with California dive sites and add locations to the database over time.
